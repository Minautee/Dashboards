#### Halloween is synonymous with candy, but not all treats are created equal. This project dives deep into a dataset of 85 popular candies, ranking them by a variety of factors to determine which ones reign supreme in the hearts of trick-or-treaters. 

 ###  $${\color{orange}Project}$$ $${\color{orange}Description:}$$

This dashboard identifies the top 3 candies‚Äî $${\color{brown}Twix}$$, $${\color{brown}Reese‚Äôs}$$ $${\color{brown}Peanut}$$ $${\color{brown}Butter}$$ $${\color{brown}Cup}$$, and $${\color{brown}Reese‚Äôs}$$ $${\color{brown}Stuffed}$$ $${\color{brown}with}$$ $${\color{brown}Pieces}$$‚Äîbased on ranking against a weighted score, making them the best choices for satisfying a wide range of tastes.

 ###  $${\color{orange}Key}$$ $${\color{orange}Metrics:}$$

**Total Candies**: Calculates the total no. of candies in the dataset which is 85

**Combined Score**: Calculates weighted score against each candy by giving 60% weightage to win percent and 20% weightage to sugar percent and price percent each. This was based on the relationship obtained between sugar vs. price vs. win using a scatter plot. It showed that chocolates with a bit higher sugar content and a moderate price range were among the most popular.

**Candy Rank**: Calculates the rank for each candy based on the Combined Score.

**Combined Characteristics**: Calculates a list of characteristics (chocolaty, caramel, fruity, etc.) and types (bar, hard, pluribus, etc.) for each candy.

**Category Count**: Calculates the count of each combo obtained through Combined Charactersitics.

 ###  $${\color{orange}Analysis}$$ $${\color{orange}Description:}$$

‚û°Ô∏è**Characteristics and Types**: Visual breakdowns of candy types (e.g., chocolate, caramel, fruity) and formats (bars, hard candies, etc.) to show diversity across the dataset.

‚û°Ô∏è**Combos and Popularity**: It visually identifies which mixes of candy characteristics are most common, helping users see trends in candy production and selection. Based on this, found the most popular combos.

‚û°Ô∏è**Price and Sugar Analysis**: Scatter plots that map candy popularity against sugar content and price, helping users balance cost with crowd appeal.

‚û°Ô∏è**Ranking Table**: A matrix table to show the breakdown of sugar, price, and win percentages based on which weighted score is calculated and accordingly ranking is assigned to each chocolate.

### $${\color{orange}Conclusion:}$$ 

* Chocolate bars/pluribus are more popular than fruity pluribus candies.
* People prefer sweeter chocolates with moderate pricing.
* Though nuts (peanuty-almondy and nougat) are not present in a lot of candies, there is an equal distribution of the preferences of nuts among the top 10 candies.
